/*
 * diff_views_page.js - injected into the claude.ai page (Code tab) by
 * js/diff_views_main.js on dom-ready. Adds a diff-scope dropdown to the
 * epitaxy diff view: Working tree / Branch changes / Latest turn.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-31 pivot - see the ADDENDUM at the end of
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-diff-view-modes-design.md)
 * ============================================================
 * This file NO LONGER RENDERS ANYTHING but the dropdown. The stock diff panel
 * gets its data from local, patchable main-process handlers registered on the
 * PER-WEBCONTENTS ipc (electron's `webContents.ipc`, NOT the global ipcMain -
 * see the interception note in js/diff_views_main.js): LocalSessions
 * getGitDiff / getGitDiffStats / getGitDiffFilePatch / getDiffFileContent. The
 * three modes are therefore ARGUMENT REWRITES applied main-side, not custom
 * rendering. The stock renderer then draws every mode - syntax highlighting,
 * virtualisation, theming and line comments all come back for free.
 *
 * Deleted with the pivot (do not reintroduce here): the unified-diff parser,
 * the line-number gutters, the --diffs-* row palette, our own body element,
 * and the hide/restore/re-point machinery that used to swap the stock file
 * list out. Nothing in this file hides, moves or restyles stock DOM any more;
 * the only mutation is inserting one <select> into the chrome row.
 *
 * DOM facts this still depends on (live-confirmed 2026-07-31, claude.ai-web.log):
 *   - ".epitaxy-pane-close-control" is the per-view chrome handle; its
 *     parentElement is the breadcrumb row ("master -> branch", ⤢, ✕).
 *   - "button.epitaxy-panel-subheader" is the sticky PER-FILE header button and
 *     "div.epitaxy-diff-panel" its content; a view has N such pairs. The
 *     presence of ANY diff marker under the same container is what
 *     distinguishes the diff view from Terminal / the in-app browser (both of
 *     which also have a close control).
 *   - QUALIFICATION IS ANY-OF, NOT ALL-OF (fixed 2026-08-01). Requiring BOTH the
 *     header button and ".epitaxy-diff-panel" was a live bug: ".epitaxy-diff-panel"
 *     is the EXPANDED per-file content, and a large diff renders every file
 *     COLLAPSED ("Files are collapsed for large diffs. Select a file to expand
 *     it."), so the element does not exist at all. Log evidence 2026-08-01
 *     00:40:46-00:42:57, four identical dumps: "headers=12 panels=0
 *     hasViewPanelWrapper=true stepsToFirstPair=3" - a real, fully chromed,
 *     12-file diff view that the gate rejected. Earlier rounds only ever looked
 *     right because a small diff auto-expands. See VIEW_MARKERS.
 *   - The dropdown goes to the LEFT of the whole trailing control cluster.
 *   - The EXPANDED (⤢) panel has its own chrome row, so a view can present two
 *     rows at different times. Only one of them is on screen, so the "one
 *     dropdown per view" guard is visibility-aware (viewServedByDisplayedRow)
 *     rather than presence-in-document-aware; the latter left the fullscreen
 *     header with no dropdown while the mode still applied.
 *   - AN INSTALL IS RE-VALIDATED ON EVERY SWEEP (added 2026-08-04). Upstream
 *     REUSES the chrome-row DOM when it swaps which tile owns that row, and our
 *     <select> is a foreign node React does not manage - so it survived the
 *     row's contents being replaced and ended up in the in-app browser panel
 *     (measured: "tileId=preview markers: [] wouldQualify: false ourDropdown:
 *     TRUE"). revalidateInstalls() re-resolves each install's view through the
 *     SAME resolveView()/qualifiesAsView() path the install used and removes any
 *     dropdown whose containing view no longer qualifies. It only ever REMOVES;
 *     it never tightens the ANY-OF marker rule above.
 *
 * HONEST AVAILABILITY (2026-07-31): "Latest turn" is only offered when the main
 * process reports a turn snapshot FOR THIS REPO (state().hasTurnSnapshot, now a
 * per-cwd answer). Otherwise the <option> is disabled with the title
 * "no turn recorded in this repo yet" and a low-frequency state() poll re-enables
 * it the moment one is recorded. The dropdown must never offer a mode that would
 * silently render something else - that was the reported bug.
 *
 * FEATURE SWITCH (2026-07-31): the feature is OPT-IN - Settings -> Extra ->
 * Features -> "Diff view modes", off by default. The pref lives main-side and is
 * reported by state().enabled, which this file polls slowly for the life of the
 * page - so flipping the switch removes the <select> from every chrome row (stock
 * header, untouched) or puts it back at Working tree, in both directions, without
 * an app restart. Until it is turned on nothing is injected at all. Main makes
 * its own interception a pass-through and stops taking turn snapshots at the
 * same time.
 *
 * A claude.ai redeploy that renames these classes degrades this to a no-op
 * (the sweep finds nothing, the mandatory diagnostic fires) - it must never
 * break the stock view.
 *
 * DIAGNOSTICS CHANNEL: every [cdb-dv] line uses console.warn, never
 * console.log - verified live that ~/.config/Claude/logs/claude.ai-web.log
 * forwards only console.warn/console.error, so console.log would have been
 * silently unrecoverable for field debugging.

  // EVIDENCE, and its limits, so the next release need not re-derive this:
  //  - The SPA uses TanStack Query v5. Confirmed from the persisted cache
  //    envelope {buster,timestamp,clientState:{mutations,queries}} under the
  //    localStorage key "react-query-cache-ls" (= persistQueryClient +
  //    createSyncStoragePersister); `gcTime` present and `cacheTime` absent
  //    pins it to v5. Real queryKeys there look like
  //    ["sessions_api_list_sessions",{orgUuid},{params}].
  //  - v5's focusManager revalidates on "visibilitychange", so a synthetic one
  //    can make a STALE query refetch. We CANNOT prove that reaches the diff
  //    query: the chunk that fetches it is not recoverable locally (the HTTP
  //    cache bodies are zstd/br compressed), so refetchOnWindowFocus and
  //    staleTime for that query are unknown, and NO queryKey containing
  //    "diff" exists in any readable cache. getGitDiff* appears only as an
  //    eipc channel name in the preload, never in SPA code.
  //  - There is NO invalidation hook to call: enumerating window.__* across the
  //    caches yields only __coworkHtmlReviewGuest and the React devtools hook,
  //    and globalThis.__* yields nothing at all.
  //  - The PRIMARY nudge is therefore MAIN-SIDE: js/diff_views_main.js replays
  //    upstream's own { type:"git_state_changed", sessionId } on the
  //    LocalSessions onEvent channel (a real webContents.send push path,
  //    verified in the bundle). This function is the harmless second half.

  // reliably identifiable but nothing that reliably REOPENS the diff view is,
  // so a synthetic close would just leave the user staring at a shut panel.

  // ------------------------------------------------------------------ //
  // DEFECT B (2026-08-04, measured live): the diff-scope dropdown turned up in
  // the in-app browser/preview panel's toolbar row. With `preview` as the only
  // mounted side tile the probe read
  //     panel tileId=preview  markers: []  wouldQualify: false  ourDropdown: TRUE
  // - i.e. the <select> was sitting in a panel our OWN qualification check
  // rejects, so it was never mis-installed by a bad gate. It is a STALE
  // LEFTOVER: upstream REUSES the chrome-row DOM when it swaps which tile owns
  // that row, and our <select> is a foreign node React does not manage, so it
  // survives the row's contents being replaced and rides along into whatever
  // view now owns the row. Panel tabs made it easy to hit (one row serves
  // several tiles in quick succession) but the bug is entirely ours.
  //
  // Nothing already here could catch it:
  //   - pruneInstalls() only asks whether the row is still in the DOCUMENT,
  //     and it is - it was reused, not removed.
  //   - installOnCloseControl() settles an already-served row (row.__cdbDv with
  //     both our nodes still inside it) BEFORE it re-resolves the view at all.
  //     That is deliberate and must stay: a mode switch can legitimately empty
  //     the diff, and re-qualifying there would read the emptied panel as "not
  //     a diff view".
  // So the re-validation belongs where the install LIST is - the sweep - and it
  // has to be a POSITIVE re-qualification, never a "the node is still in the
  // document" proxy, which is exactly what already failed.
  //
  // The view is re-resolved from the row's own live close control through the
  // SAME resolveView() the install used, so the qualification rule stays in
  // ONE place: no second marker set, no separate notion of "is a diff view".
  //
  // DELIBERATELY NOT TIGHTENED (this is the edge case that motivated the loose
  // marker, see VIEW_MARKERS): qualification is ANY-OF, because a LARGE diff
  // renders every file COLLAPSED and ".epitaxy-diff-panel" then does not exist
  // at all - a real 12-file diff view legitimately shows only the per-file
  // header marker. The empty-diff fallback (qualifiesAsEmptyDiffView) still
  // counts as qualifying too. This function only ever removes an install whose
  // containing view fails that EXISTING gate; it never adds a requirement.
  //
  // A row whose close control has gone is left alone: that is a half-rendered
  // row, not a wrong one, and pruneInstalls() already owns the "row is gone"
  // case. Torn down WHOLE via teardownRow(), so the row is left exactly as a
