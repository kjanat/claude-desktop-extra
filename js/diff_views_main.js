/*
 * diff_views_main.js - main-process half of the diff view modes feature.
 * Injected into .vite/build/index.js by patches/add_feature_diff_views.nim.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * ARCHITECTURE (2026-07-31 pivot - ADDENDUM in
 * docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-31-diff-view-modes-design.md)
 * ============================================================
 * We no longer render our own diff. The stock diff panel's DATA comes from
 * local, patchable main-process eipc handlers, so the three modes are
 * ARGUMENT REWRITES applied to those handlers and the STOCK renderer draws
 * everything (syntax highlighting, virtualisation, theming, line comments).
 *
 * Jobs:
 *   1. Learn the active Code session's project cwd + user-turn starts by
 *      wrapping child creation (runtime hook - no regex on minified code).
 *   2. Snapshot the working tree (temp-index write-tree) at each turn start.
 *   3. Intercept the LocalSessions git-diff IPC registrations and rewrite
 *      their arguments according to the current mode.
 *   4. Detect the TRUE base branch (closest fork point) and apply it in EVERY
 *      mode - including pass-through/"working" - plus report it back through
 *      getGitInfo so the breadcrumb names the branch we actually diff against.
 *      See "SMART BASE BRANCH DETECTION" and "MAKING THE UI HONEST" below.
 *      Escape hatch: `git config branch.<name>.cdbBaseBranch <ref>`.
 *   5. Register the bridge handlers (state, set-mode) and own the feature's own
 *      preference - `diffViewModes` in claude-desktop-extra.json, default FALSE
 *      (OPT-IN), read/written here and switched from Settings -> Extra ->
 *      Features. Off makes every wrapper a byte-identical pass-through and takes
 *      no turn snapshots, live, no restart; see "FEATURE PREFERENCE" below.
 *   6. Inject the page UI (diff_views_page.js) on every http(s) dom-ready.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * INTERCEPTION POINT - CORRECTION TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * The pivot brief assumed the registrations go through electron's global
 * `ipcMain.handle`. They DO NOT. Verified in the 1.24012.9 bundle
 * (index.chunk-BOXWZA6T.js): the interface object registers with
 *
 *     e.ipc.removeHandler(<channel>), e.ipc.handle(<channel>, async (ev, ...) => ...)
 *
 * where `e` is a raw Electron **WebContents** (call sites: `R0e(e.webContents,
 * yo)` / `R0e(t.webContents, e)`), so `e.ipc` is electron's per-WebContents
 * `webContents.ipc`, NOT `ipcMain`. Electron dispatches `invoke` against
 * webFrameMain.ipc -> webContents.ipc -> ipcMain, first match wins, so a
 * webContents.ipc registration pre-empts the global map entirely: wrapping
 * only `ipcMain.handle` would have intercepted NOTHING.
 * We therefore wrap `wc.ipc.handle` for every WebContents (our
 * "web-contents-created" listener is registered at bundle top, so it runs
 * before the app's own per-WebContents setup), and ALSO wrap `ipcMain.handle`
 * as a belt-and-braces catch in case a future release moves registration
 * there. Both are stable Electron APIs - still no regex on minified code.
 *
 * Channel matching is SUFFIX-based ("..._$_LocalSessions_$_getGitDiff"): the
 * full literal embeds a codegen UUID
 * ($eipc_message$_e2afa475-a4a7-4b20-823a-d301e4191c67_$_claude.web_$_...)
 * that can change per release.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERIFIED HANDLER CONTRACTS (1.24012.9) - all results are `T | null`, all
 * argument validation is imperative typeof checks that THROW on mismatch:
 *   getGitDiff(cwd, base, head?, options?)
 *       options validator accepts only {includePatches?: boolean}
 *       -> {base_ref, head_ref, merge_base, files:[{filename,status,additions,
 *           deletions,changes,patch?,previous_filename?}], ahead_by, behind_by,
 *          total_commits} | null
 *   getGitDiffStats(cwd, base, head?)            (NO options arg)
 *       -> {additions, deletions, fileCount, ahead_by, behind_by} | null
 *   getGitDiffFilePatch(cwd, mergeBase, filePath, prevFilePath?)
 *       -> string | null              (plain string, NOT {patch: ...})
 *   getDiffFileContent(cwd, mergeBase, filePath, prevFilePath?)
 *       -> {oldText: string|null, newText: string|null} | null
 *
 * The two per-file methods take only ONE ref (mergeBase) and diff it against
 * the WORKTREE internally, so an argument rewrite alone cannot express
 * "merge-base..HEAD" for Branch mode. Since their result shapes are confirmed
 * we COMPUTE those two ourselves with git and return the confirmed shapes, so
 * per-file content stays consistent with the rewritten file list. (For Turn
 * mode an arg rewrite would in fact suffice - the "now" tree IS the worktree -
 * but one code path for both modes is simpler and provably consistent.)
 *
 * REF SHAPES UPSTREAM ACCEPTS (verified against the 1.24012.9 pipeline and by
 * running the same git commands in a real repo, 2026-07-31):
 *   - Branch mode MUST pass 40-hex COMMIT shas. Symbolic refs are re-resolved
 *     by upstream with an origin/<ref> preference and collapse to an empty
 *     diff; see the long root-cause note above resolveBranchRefs.
 *   - Turn mode's TREE shas are fine. `rev-parse --verify <tree-sha>` succeeds,
 *     so both resolvers return them verbatim; `merge-base <tree> <tree>` fails
 *     with "is a tree, not a commit" and upstream's own catch falls back to the
 *     base ref, which is exactly the tree we want, and `git diff <tree> <tree>`
 *     is valid. Only ahead_by/behind_by/total_commits come back 0 (the rev-list
 *     probe fails and is caught) - cosmetic; nothing in the diff path gates on
 *     them (the sole aheadBy===0 short-circuit is in the commit-LIST function).
 *
 * SECURITY: the caller is remote claude.ai code. Our own handlers validate the
 * sender and take only a mode enum; cwd comes exclusively from our own spawn
 * hook, and every git invocation uses a fixed argv (no shell).

  //   S.modeCwd  the repo the mode was selected FOR (null in working mode)

  //   S.cwd      the most recent spawn cwd THAT IS A GIT WORK TREE (non-repo
  //              spawns such as /home/deli are ignored outright now). Still a

  // map below; a single global slot was the cause of the "Latest turn renders as
  // Working tree" bug (long note there).

  // home-dir and background sessions constantly. Binding the mode to S.cwd,
  // or resetting the mode from onSessionSpawn on a cwd change, would therefore
  // attribute the mode to the wrong repo and/or destroy the user's selection a

  // ---- FEATURE PREFERENCE (Settings -> Extra -> Features -> Diff view modes) --
  //
  // DEFAULT FALSE - THE FEATURE IS OPT-IN (user decision, 2026-07-31). It changes
  // how the STOCK diff panel behaves: it rewrites the arguments of Anthropic's own
  // git IPC and corrects the base branch the panel compares against. Something
  // that reshapes a first-party surface should be asked for, not assumed, so a
  // fresh install behaves exactly like the official build until the switch in
  // Settings -> Extra -> Features is turned on. A MISSING key therefore means OFF.
  //
  // OWNERSHIP, deliberately: the pref is READ AND WRITTEN HERE, by the patch that
  // owns the behaviour, and the Extra settings page reaches it through two fixed
  // channels of OURS (cdb-diff:pref-read / cdb-diff:pref-set) exposed on
  // window.cdbExtra - the same cross-patch arrangement the theme picker already
  // has with cdb-themes:apply. The settings patch stays the single writer of
  // `growthbookOverrides`; it is NOT the writer of this key. Both writers
  // read-modify-write the same .json and rename atomically, and they never touch
  // each other's keys, so the only exposure is two simultaneous edits of
  // DIFFERENT keys - which is what the theme picker already lives with.
  //
  // WHEN OFF, EVERYTHING OF OURS IS INERT AND LIVE-REVERSIBLE:
  //   - wrapListener and wrapGitInfoListener hand the original arguments to the
  //     original handler and return its result, before ANY planning, git or ref
  //     resolution work happens (the early returns are the first statement),
  //   - every remembered mode is reset to "working", so nothing stays rewritten,
  //   - cdb-diff:state reports enabled:false and the page removes its dropdown,
  //   - onSessionSpawn and onUserTurn return immediately, so NO turn snapshot is
  //     taken: while off, snapshotTree's three git commands per turn would be
  //     work nobody can read. The stdin hook itself stays installed (it is pure
  //     string matching, no git), which is what lets turning the switch on
  //     mid-session start recording from that turn onward with no restart. The
  //     first turn after enabling may find no snapshot yet - the existing
  //     "Latest turn is disabled and says why" path covers exactly that.
  // The wrappers themselves STAY installed: they are put in place once, at
  // channel-registration time, and switching back on must not need a restart.

  // per-record companion `df`: a bare '"type":"user"' check also matches
  // tool-result echoes (tool results are type:"user" too), so tool_result /
  // isMeta / isCompactSummary lines are excluded. Both compact and
  // spaced-colon forms are checked, exactly as the bundle does.
  //
  // RE-VERIFIED AGAINST THE BUNDLE 2026-07-31 (turn detection was suspected of
  // never firing; it does fire - the pass-through had a different cause):
  //   - There is exactly ONE `--input-format","stream-json"` argv site. Its
  //     transport spawns with stdio ["pipe","pipe","pipe"], so child.stdin
  //     exists synchronously when our spawn hook runs.
  //   - The ONLY writer is that transport's `write(t)`, doing a bare
  //     `this.processStdin.write(t)` on a string - no Transform, no cork, no
  //     pipe() into stdin, and the stream is never swapped on a live child.
  //     `processStdin` is a plain value copy of `child.stdin`, which is why we
  //     wrap the STREAM OBJECT (not the child property) - the copy then points
  //     at the already-wrapped stream.
  //   - Frames are serialized with JSON.stringify and NO space argument, so the
  //     literal is the compact `"type":"user"` and `type` is the first key.
  //   - `isMeta` and `isCompactSummary` are NEVER set on outbound frames (they
  //     only appear in inbound transcript-reading code), so those exclusions can
  //     never cause a false negative.
  //   - Outbound user frames DO carry `parent_tool_use_id:null` on every turn -
  //     that must not be treated as a tool result.
  //
  // isSynthetic ADDED for the same reason isMeta is excluded: the bundle injects
  // `{type:"user", ..., isSynthetic:true}` notification frames, and a synthetic
  // injection is not a user turn - letting one move the turn boundary would make
  // "Latest turn" silently show an empty diff.
  //
  // KNOWN LIMITATION (documented, not a bug): an SSH-backed session replaces the
  // spawn with the transport's own `spawnClaudeCodeProcess`, whose stdin is a
  // PassThrough forwarded over RPC - no child_process.spawn happens, so our hook
  // never sees it and turn mode simply stays unavailable there (state() reports
  // hasTurnSnapshot:false and the page disables the option).

  // head = "HEAD". Upstream then resolved those itself, and its HEAD resolver
  // PREFERS A REMOTE REF. Verified in tmp/staged-index.js (1.24012.9):
  //
  //   async function jt(t,e,r){ if(!e||e.startsWith("-")) throw ...;
  //     try{ await t.run(["rev-parse","--verify",`origin/${e}`],r); return `origin/${e}` }catch{}
  //     await t.run(["rev-parse","--verify",e],r); return e }
  //
  // `git rev-parse --verify origin/HEAD` SUCCEEDS in any clone with a remote
  // (origin/HEAD is a symref to the remote default branch), so resolvedHead
  // became "origin/HEAD" - i.e. origin/master - the very commit the base
  // resolves to. Its sibling base resolver (ht) prefers origin/<base> the same
  // way, so with base "master" upstream ended up computing
  //   mergeBase = merge-base(origin/master, origin/HEAD) = origin/master
  //   diff mergeBase..resolvedHead = diff X..X = EMPTY
  // which is exactly the `files=0 patches=true` lines in main.log. Reproduced
  // in this repo: symbolic refs -> 0 files, resolved shas -> 5 files.
  //
  // THE FIX: resolve both refs to 40-hex OBJECT SHAS ourselves and pass those.
  // `git rev-parse --verify origin/<40-hex>` fails ("Needed a single revision"),
  // so ht/jt both fall through to their second branch and return our sha
  // verbatim - no remote-ref substitution is possible any more. This also makes

  // handler - which re-applies its own trusted-cwd gate - so nothing here can

  // is `develop`. When master carries commits develop does not have yet,
  // merge-base(develop, HEAD) is an OLDER ancestor than the true fork point, so

  // "develop -> <branch>", naming a base we were not usefully diffing against.
  //
  // DETECTION IS CONVENTION-AGNOSTIC. This is a public package, so no repo- or
  // employer-specific branch names appear here. The candidate set is bounded and
  // generic: the repository's own origin/HEAD default, the four generic mainline
  // names below, and the current branch's own tracking ref. The winner is the
  // candidate with the FEWEST commits in <candidate>..HEAD, i.e. the CLOSEST
  // fork point - the branch we most likely branched from.
  //
  // ESCAPE HATCH - pin a base per branch, no rebuild and no restart needed:
  //
  //     git config branch.<branch-name>.cdbBaseBranch <ref>
  //
  // This is the ONLY override key, and it wins OUTRIGHT over auto-detection: an
  // explicit pin is never second-guessed by a heuristic. Unset it to go back to
  // auto-detection:
  //
  //     git config --unset branch.<branch-name>.cdbBaseBranch
  //
  // PRIORITY: config override -> auto-detect -> upstream's own base argument.
  //
  // NOT honoured: `branch.<name>.gh-merge-base`. It was read as a second override
  // key for one round and has been removed. `gh` writes a merge-base COMMIT ID
  // there, not a base ref, so it would put a 40-hex sha into the field the
  // breadcrumb renders as a branch name - and `gh` does not invalidate that cache
  // across a rebase, so a stale entry would have beaten our own (correct)
  // detection. Auto-detection already finds the fork point `gh` cached.

   * The two used to disagree: this one needed only snap.modeCwd, while
   * computeFilePlan additionally required snap.cwd (the repo our own spawn hook
   * observed). Whenever the second held and the first did not, the panel showed
   * a branch-scoped file list whose rows were filled from the stock
   * working-tree handler - mismatched data, presented as one diff. Two ways in:
   * flipping the pref on mid-session (the pref-gated spawn hook never ran, so
   * nothing was ever observed), and LRU eviction of the repo's entry between
   * the list fetch and a lazy per-file fetch. Both are closed by requiring the
   * SAME snap.cwd binding here, so the coarse channel can never run ahead of
   * the per-file one. The cost is honest and visible: until the repo is
   * observed, all four channels serve stock and effectiveMode() reports
   * "working", so the dropdown does not claim a mode that is not applied.

   * PURE. Base substitution for the pass-through ("working") mode.
   *
   * WHY WORKING MODE IS TOUCHED AT ALL (user-approved, 2026-07-31): the base
   * upstream picks is wrong for any branch not cut from the remote default, and
   * "Working tree" is the DEFAULT view - so leaving it alone would mean the bug
   * the user reported is still what they see on open. This OVERRIDES a stock
   * choice, so it is gated hard: `dec.overrode` is only true when our candidate
   * differs from what the SPA sent AND is demonstrably closer (strictly smaller
   * ahead-count), or the user pinned it in git config. Otherwise the call is
   * left completely untouched and the panel behaves exactly like stock.
   *
   * The base is substituted as a 40-HEX SHA, never a branch name: upstream
   * re-resolves symbolic refs with an origin/<ref> preference, which is the
   * documented empty-diff trap (see the ref-resolution block above). `head` is
   * left EXACTLY as the SPA sent it - undefined means "working tree", which is
   * the whole point of this mode - and the options argument is not touched
   * either, so this is the minimum possible intervention.

  //
  // EVIDENCE (1.24012.9, tmp/staged-index.js) - this is a real push channel, not
  // a guess. The eipc codegen builds a per-WebContents dispatcher whose event
  // methods are plain webContents.send calls:
  //   dispatchOnEvent(r){ if(!DJe(r)) throw ...;
  //     e.send("$eipc_message$_<uuid>_$_claude.web_$_LocalSessions_$_onEvent", r) }

  // git memos:
  //   for (const o of s) this.gitStatus.invalidateDiffsFor(o);
  //   this.emit("event", { type: "git_state_changed", sessionId: r })
  // Every emitted event reaches that dispatcher unfiltered - the intermediary
  // C8e/dispatchOrCaptureSessionEvent is only a try/catch + Sentry wrapper, it
  // drops nothing. (Note the events ride the same "$eipc_message$" prefix as
  // the invoke channels; searching for an "$eipc_event$" prefix finds nothing
  // and wrongly suggests there is no push path.)

  // The producer (fetchGitInfoUncached) also sets `remote`; wK ignores unknown
  // keys, so extra fields are legal and we preserve every one of them.
  //
  // WHY THIS IS THE RIGHT CHANNEL: `defaultBranch` is BOTH the breadcrumb's base
  // label ("develop -> <branch>") and the value the SPA passes as the `base`
  // argument to getGitDiff. Correcting this ONE field therefore fixes the label
  // and upstream's own base choice together - which is why in practice the
  // working-mode rewrite above rarely has to fire at all. The two layers agree
  // by construction: once getGitInfo reports our base, the SPA sends it, and
  // shouldOverrideUpstreamBase sees "same answer as upstream" and leaves it be.
  //
  // FAIL CLOSED. A null result, a shape that would not satisfy wK, a
